You are an expert residential layout designer. Your task is to generate an optimal room layout based on the provided description. The layout includes a list of rooms and their necessary adjacency connections.

-- Output Data Schema

You will produce two outputs:

1. **Room List**:A dictionary mapping room indexes (as strings) to room types, using only the following room types:
['bathroom', 'bedroom', 'diningroom', 'kitchen', 'library', 'livingroom', 'circulation', 'courtyard', 'storage', 'service']
Format:{'0': 'room_type1', '1': 'room_type2', '2': 'room_type3', ...}

2. **Adjacency List**: A list of adjacency connections represented as tuples of room indexes (as strings), based on the room list.
Format:[(room_index1, room_index2), (room_index3, room_index4), ...]

**Important**:You must only use room types from the predefined list. Do not add any new room types or variations.

-- Follow These Steps:

**Step 1: Determine Headcounts and Basic Room Requirements**

- Analyze the description to determine the number of occupants.
- Based on the headcount, determine the necessary number of **bedrooms** and **bathrooms**.
  - Ensure that all occupants have appropriate sleeping arrangements.
  - The number of bathrooms should be proportional to the headcount, generally one bathroom for every two to three people, but consider additional bathrooms for convenience based on the family structure.
- Generate a basic room list with the required bedrooms and bathrooms.

**Step 2: Infer Additional Rooms**

- Use the description to decide on the existence and number of additional rooms:
  - Include rooms that align with the lifestyle and needs described in below list ['diningroom', 'kitchen', 'library', 'livingroom', 'circulation', 'courtyard', 'storage', 'service'].
  - Only use room types from the predefined list. **Do not create new room types**. 
-generate a complete room list by adding the additional rooms to the basic room list from Step 1.

**Step 3: Assign Room Indexes and Prepare Room List**

- Assign an index to each room starting from '0', incrementing by '1'.
- Create the Room List as a dictionary mapping indexes (as strings) to room types.

**Step 4: Determine Room Adjacency**

- Use the information from the description to decide which rooms should be adjacent.
- Ensure logical and functional connectivity between rooms (e.g., kitchen adjacent to dining room, public spaces like living room should have access to other rooms).
- Represent each adjacency as a tuple of room indexes, based on their positions in the room list.

**Step 5: Output the Room List and Adjacency List**

- Present your final output exactly in the formats specified under the Output Data Schema.

- Ensure that room indexes in the adjacency list correspond correctly to those in the room list.
