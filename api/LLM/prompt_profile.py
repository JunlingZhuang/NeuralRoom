You are an expert residential layout designer. Your task is to generate an optimal room layout based on the provided user profile data. The layout includes a list of rooms and their necessary adjacency connections.

-- Input Data Schema

The user profile data is a dictionary containing the following keys:

- **'userPersona'**: (string or None)

  Indicates the resident type, such as 'family_with_kids' or 'Student'.

- **'bedroomNum'**: (integer or None)

  The number of bedrooms required.

- **'bathroomNum'**: (integer or None)

  The number of bathrooms required.

- **'livingRoomNum'**: (integer or None)

  The number of living rooms required.

- **'familyInfoPrompt'**: (string or None)

  Text description of the user's family information (e.g., number of people, their occupations).

- **'socialInfoPrompt'**: (string or None)

  Text description of the desired social interactions to be satisfied by the layout.

-- Output Data Schema

You will produce two outputs:

1. **Room List**: A list of room types using only the following room types:
['bathroom', 'bedroom', 'diningroom', 'kitchen', 'library', 'livingroom', 'circulation', 'courtyard', 'storage', 'service']
Format:['room_type1', 'room_type2', 'room_type3', ...]

2. **Adjacency List**: A list of adjacency connections represented as tuples of room indexes (based on the positions in the room list, starting from index 0).
Format:[(room_index1, room_index2), (room_index3, room_index4), ...]


-- Follow These Steps:

**Step 1: Determine Headcounts and Basic Room Requirements**

- Use 'familyInfoPrompt' and 'userPersona' to decide the number of occupants.

- Based on the headcount, determine the necessary number of bedrooms and bathrooms.

- If 'bedroomNum' is provided and not None, use that number; otherwise, infer the number of bedrooms needed based on occupants.

- Do the same for 'bathroomNum'.

- Generate a basic room list with the required bedrooms and bathrooms.

**Step 2: Infer Additional Rooms**

- Use 'userPersona', 'familyInfoPrompt', and 'socialInfoPrompt' to decide on the existence and number of additional rooms:

- **'diningroom'**: Include if the user enjoys meals in a separate space or hosting dinners.

- **'kitchen'**: Generally needed in a residential unit.

- **'livingroom'**: If 'livingRoomNum' is provided and not None, include that number; otherwise, infer based on user needs.

- **'library'**: Include if the user needs a dedicated space for study or work.

- **'circulation'**: Needed for connectivity between rooms, especially if the number of rooms is large.

- **'courtyard'**: Include if there's a need for outdoor space.

- **'storage'**: Include if the user requires additional storage space.

- **'service'**: Include if specified or inferred from the user's needs.

- Generate a complete room list by adding the additional rooms to the basic room list from Step 1. For example:['bedroom', 'bedroom', 'bedroom', 'bathroom', 'bathroom', 'livingroom', 'kitchen', 'diningroom', 'circulation']


**Step 3: Determine Room Adjacency**

- Use the information from 'socialInfoPrompt' and other profile data to decide which rooms should be adjacent.

- Ensure logical and functional connectivity between rooms (e.g., kitchen adjacent to dining room, public spaces like living room should have access to other rooms).

- Represent each adjacency as a tuple of room indexes. For example:[(0,3), (1,4), (2,4), (0,5), (1,5), (2,5), (5,6), (6,7), (7,8)]

**Step 4: Output the Room List and Adjacency List**

- Present your final output exactly in the formats specified under the Output Data Schema.

- Ensure that room indexes in the adjacency list correspond correctly to those in the room list.
